# PixelPrint

Turn your photos into unique ASCII art masterpieces with customizable styles and high-quality outputs!

## Core Features

- Image-to-ASCII Conversion – The main feature that converts an uploaded image into ASCII art, retaining enough detail to resemble the original.
- Customizable ASCII Styles – Allow users to select different ASCII "fonts" or character sets (e.g., using symbols, letters, or different grayscale characters).
- Brightness/Contrast Control – Enable users to adjust brightness and contrast to fine-tune the ASCII art output.
- Color ASCII Output – Offer an option to create colorized ASCII art to give an extra pop of detail (if feasible).
- Real-Time Preview (Web Only) – Provide an in-app preview where users can see the ASCII version while adjusting settings before finalizing the image.

## Backend & Processing Features

- Efficient Image Processing – Perform the ASCII conversion on the backend to handle large image files without putting too much strain on the frontend.
- High-Resolution Options – Give users the option to select different resolution outputs, so they can create high-quality ASCII art for print or web use.
- Queue System for Heavy Loads – Implement a queue system in the backend for handling multiple requests if there are several users or large files being processed.
- Export Formats – Offer downloadable formats such as text files (ASCII art), high-quality images (JPEG, PNG), and PDFs.

## Additional Features (Future Enhancements)

- ASCII Animation Mode – Allow users to create ASCII versions of short video clips or GIFs. This could be incredibly unique but might require more processing power.
- Interactive ASCII Art Editor – Let users manually tweak individual ASCII characters on the final image for a more hands-on editing experience.
- Custom ASCII Characters – Allow users to upload their own set of ASCII characters or symbols for a fully personalized ASCII art style.
- Photo Filters for ASCII Art – Add traditional photo editing features (brightness, contrast, color inversion) that affect the ASCII output.
- Community Gallery – Allow users to share their ASCII art on a public gallery within the app where they can like and comment on each other’s work.
- Auto-Sharing to Social Media – Integrate social sharing options to share the ASCII art directly on platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.
- Text Watermarking – Allow users to add custom text or watermark signatures to their ASCII creations.

## User Experience & UI Enhancements

- Camera Integration – For the web app, add a live camera view that converts the live image feed into ASCII art in real time.
- Real-Time ASCII Preview for Mobile – Add a toggle to switch between live camera view and real-time ASCII preview for an interactive experience on mobile.
- ASCII Presets – Provide users with a set of predefined ASCII styles (e.g., retro, grayscale, colorful, emoji-based) for one-click transformations.
- Multi-Platform Design Consistency – Ensure the design is consistent across the web app and mobile app, offering an intuitive user experience on both platforms.
- Offline Processing (For Mobile) – For the mobile app, consider allowing offline image-to-ASCII processing (this might require some optimization to avoid excessive battery drain).
